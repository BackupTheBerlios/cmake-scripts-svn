These CMake scripts are used in my projects' CMakeLists.txt files. Most of
them are used to locate libraries needed by the projects. Some of
them were downloaded from the web and been possibly modified. Some others
are based on those dowloaded from the web, but try to find other libraries.

All the comments at the beginning of the scripts are kept intact, after them
might come some of my own comments. I also try to indicate where I got the
original files from.
